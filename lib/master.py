"""
manipulate mastered entities

Library for manipulating entities in our entity master.

All functions expect integer IDs for the entities on which they are
operating, and may do unexpected things if the ID is incorrect (but
exists).  An oria.DBConnection instance is needed for each function,
as well.

Written for the University of Illinois.
